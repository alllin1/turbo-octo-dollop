# Security Vulnerabilities in Raffle Platform

Based on a thorough assessment of the codebase, I've identified the following security vulnerabilities and concerns:

## 1. Authentication & Authorization Issues

- **Simulated Authentication**: The authentication system is currently only simulated, with actual Supabase authentication calls commented out in both signin and signup pages.
- **No Password Strength Enforcement**: While there's a UI hint suggesting passwords should be 8+ characters with numbers and special characters, there's no actual validation enforcing this requirement.
- **Missing Email Verification**: No implementation of email verification despite UI suggesting this flow exists.
- **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against brute force attacks on authentication endpoints.
- **Incomplete Authorization Checks**: No clear implementation of role-based access control or permission verification for sensitive operations.

## 2. Credential Management

- **Exposed API Credentials**: Supabase URL and anonymous key are stored in `.env.local` and committed to the repository, exposing these credentials.
- **Client-Side Credential Usage**: The Supabase anonymous key is exposed to the client side via the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix, making it accessible in browser.
- **No Secure Credential Rotation**: No mechanism for secure credential rotation or management.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Insufficient Data Validation**: Limited input validation across the application, particularly for user inputs like ticket quantities and form submissions.
- **No Data Sanitization**: No evidence of sanitization for user inputs before processing or storing data.
- **Potential SQL Injection**: Direct use of user inputs in database queries without proper parameterization.
- **Missing Data Encryption**: No implementation of encryption for sensitive user data or payment information.
- **No Privacy Controls**: Lack of user consent management or data retention policies.

## 4. Web Security Protections

- **Missing CSRF Protection**: No Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens or protections implemented.
- **Potential XSS Vulnerabilities**: Direct rendering of user inputs without sanitization could lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **No Content Security Policy**: Missing CSP headers to prevent various injection attacks.
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Competition IDs and user data accessed directly via URL parameters without proper authorization checks.
- **No HTTP Security Headers**: Missing important security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.

## 5. Payment & Transaction Security

- **Incomplete Payment Processing**: Payment processing is only simulated with no actual secure implementation.
- **No PCI DSS Compliance**: Missing required security controls for handling payment card information.
- **Lack of Transaction Integrity**: No mechanisms to ensure transaction data integrity or prevent manipulation.

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment Security

- **Exposed Deployment Credentials**: Vercel access token is stored in knowledge but could potentially be exposed in code.
- **No Secure Configuration Management**: Sensitive configuration is hardcoded rather than using secure secret management.
- **Missing Security Monitoring**: No implementation of logging, monitoring, or alerting for security events.
- **Incomplete Error Handling**: Error messages may expose sensitive information about the application structure.

## 7. Compliance & Legal

- **Age Verification**: While there's a checkbox for age verification (18+), there's no actual verification mechanism.
- **Terms & Privacy Links**: Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy exist but likely point to non-existent pages.
- **Gambling Regulations**: No implementation of required controls for gambling/raffle regulations (depending on jurisdiction).

## Risk Assessment

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Impact | Likelihood |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Exposed API Credentials | High | High | High |
| Simulated Authentication | High | High | High |
| Missing Input Validation | Medium | High | Medium |
| No CSRF Protection | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Potential XSS Vulnerabilities | Medium | High | Medium |
| Incomplete Payment Processing | High | High | High |
| Missing Security Headers | Low | Medium | High |
| No Data Encryption | High | High | Medium |

## Immediate Concerns

The most critical security issues that require immediate attention are:
1. Removing exposed credentials from the repository
2. Implementing proper authentication with Supabase
3. Adding input validation and sanitization
4. Implementing CSRF and XSS protections
5. Securing payment processing implementation
