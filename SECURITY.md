# Raffle Platform Security Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security measures implemented in the raffle platform. These enhancements address critical vulnerabilities and follow industry best practices to ensure the security of user data, transactions, and the overall application.

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Authentication System

We've implemented a robust authentication system using Supabase with the following security features:

- **Secure Password Handling**: Passwords are validated for strength (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) and securely hashed using Supabase's bcrypt implementation.
- **Email Verification**: New user registrations require email verification to prevent account abuse.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper token refresh mechanisms in middleware.
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-required routes are protected at the middleware level.
- **Secure Sign-out**: Proper session termination on sign-out.

### 2. Data Protection

We've implemented multiple layers of data protection:

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database tables are protected with Row Level Security policies that ensure users can only access their own data.
- **Secure Database Functions**: Server-side functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` for critical operations like ticket purchases.
- **Transaction Integrity**: Database transactions ensure data consistency for multi-step operations.
- **Server-Side Validation**: All data access is validated on the server side, even when client-side validation is present.

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization has been implemented:

- **Zod Schema Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas with specific rules for each data type.
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Validation Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types ensure proper data handling throughout the application.

### 4. CSRF & XSS Protection

Protection against common web vulnerabilities:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection with secure token generation and validation.
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers to prevent unauthorized script execution.
- **XSS Sanitization**: HTML content is sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy.

### 5. Secure API Implementation

API endpoints are secured with:

- **Method Validation**: Endpoints only accept their intended HTTP methods.
- **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing operations require valid CSRF tokens.
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks.

### 6. Environment Variable Management

Secure handling of sensitive configuration:

- **Environment Validation**: Required environment variables are validated at startup.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Client-side variables are properly prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive values are stored in environment variables.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

When working with this codebase, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Never disable security features**: Don't bypass CSRF protection, input validation, or other security measures.
2. **Use the validation library**: Always validate user inputs using the provided Zod schemas.
3. **Follow the authentication flow**: Don't create custom authentication methods that bypass the secure implementation.
4. **Test security features**: Add tests for new features to ensure they maintain security standards.
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
6. **Use server components for sensitive operations**: Prefer server components for operations that handle sensitive data.
7. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Only request the minimum permissions needed for a function to work.

## Security Testing

The security enhancements have been tested with:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual security functions like validation and sanitization.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing the interaction between security components.
- **Manual Testing**: Verification of security features in a development environment.

## Future Security Considerations

While the current implementation provides a strong security foundation, consider these future enhancements:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for additional account security.
2. **Security Logging & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive security event logging.
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews of the codebase.
4. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct professional penetration testing before major releases.

## Conclusion

The raffle platform now implements a comprehensive security strategy that protects user data, prevents common web vulnerabilities, and follows industry best practices. These enhancements significantly improve the security posture of the application and provide a solid foundation for future development.
