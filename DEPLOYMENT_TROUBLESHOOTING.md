# Raffle Platform Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Deployment Status

The raffle platform has been deployed to Vercel, but the build process encountered errors. The deployment is currently in an error state.

- **Production URL**: https://raffle-platform-implementation-ha4hrwgrm-alllin1s-projects.vercel.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/alllin1s-projects/raffle-platform-implementation/BhsV7TSUQHghzhWqzgJChkAQfXBT

## Identified Issues

After investigating the deployment failure, we've identified the following potential issues:

1. **Dependency Version Compatibility**: The project is using very recent versions of dependencies that may not be fully supported by Vercel's build environment:
   - React 19.0.0 (very recent release)
   - Next.js 15.2.4 (very recent release)
   - Tailwind CSS 4 (very recent release)

2. **Build Process**: The error occurred during the `npm run build` step, which suggests issues with the Next.js build process.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade Dependencies

Update the `package.json` file to use more stable versions of the dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.39.0",
    "next": "14.0.4",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.0.4",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

After updating the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then redeploy to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Option 2: Check for Specific Build Errors

To get more detailed information about the build errors:

1. Visit the Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/alllin1s-projects/raffle-platform-implementation
2. Navigate to the failed deployment
3. Click on "Build Logs" to see the specific error messages
4. Address any specific issues mentioned in the logs

### Option 3: Verify Next.js Configuration

Ensure your `next.config.ts` file is correctly configured:

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### Option 4: Check for Missing Environment Variables

Verify that all required environment variables are correctly set in Vercel:

1. Visit the Vercel Dashboard
2. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
3. Ensure the following variables are set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended changes locally
2. Test the build process locally with `npm run build`
3. Once the local build succeeds, redeploy to Vercel
4. Monitor the deployment logs for any additional issues
