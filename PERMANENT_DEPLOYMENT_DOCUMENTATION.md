# Permanent Deployment Documentation for Raffle Platform

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidance for maintaining and enhancing your permanently deployed raffle platform website.

## Current Deployment Status
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Repository**: GitHub (alllin1/turbo-octo-dollop)
- **URL**: https://raffle-platform-implementation-5pq8raq99-alllin1s-projects.vercel.app
- **Backend**: Supabase (https://wmrkcxrpafsmaiasppkf.supabase.co)

## Maintaining Your Permanent Deployment

### Continuous Deployment
Your website is set up with continuous deployment from GitHub:
1. Any changes pushed to the main branch of your repository will automatically trigger a new deployment
2. Vercel will build and deploy the updated version
3. If build errors occur, you'll receive notifications from Vercel

### Environment Variables Management
For security and configuration:
1. Access your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Ensure these variables are properly set:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
4. Add any new environment variables as your project grows

### Monitoring and Analytics
To track website performance and usage:
1. Set up Vercel Analytics in your dashboard
2. Consider adding Google Analytics or Plausible for more detailed insights
3. Monitor Supabase usage through their dashboard

### Backup Procedures
Protect your data with regular backups:
1. Set up automated database backups in Supabase
2. Regularly export important data
3. Keep local copies of your codebase

## Scaling Your Deployment

### Performance Optimization
As traffic increases:
1. Implement caching strategies
2. Optimize image loading with next/image
3. Consider implementing incremental static regeneration for dynamic pages

### Database Scaling
When user base grows:
1. Monitor Supabase performance metrics
2. Upgrade your Supabase plan as needed
3. Implement database indexing for frequently queried data

### Geographic Expansion
For global audiences:
1. Utilize Vercel's Edge Network for global content delivery
2. Consider setting up regional Supabase instances for data locality

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Updates
Keep dependencies secure:
1. Regularly update npm packages with `npm update`
2. Monitor GitHub security advisories
3. Implement automated dependency updates with Dependabot

### Security Monitoring
Protect your platform:
1. Set up Vercel security headers
2. Implement rate limiting for API routes
3. Regularly review Supabase Row Level Security policies

## Custom Domain Management

### Domain Renewal
Ensure continuous availability:
1. Set up auto-renewal for your domain
2. Keep payment methods updated with your registrar
3. Set calendar reminders for manual renewals

### SSL Certificate Management
Maintain secure connections:
1. Vercel automatically manages SSL certificates
2. Ensure your domain's DNS settings remain correctly configured
3. Monitor certificate expiration dates in Vercel dashboard

## Disaster Recovery

### Rollback Procedures
If deployment issues occur:
1. Access deployment history in Vercel dashboard
2. Select a previous working deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Emergency Contacts
Keep these handy:
1. Vercel Support: support@vercel.com
2. Supabase Support: support@supabase.io
3. Domain Registrar Support (varies by provider)

## Future-Proofing

### Technology Updates
Stay current:
1. Plan for Next.js version upgrades
2. Test in staging environment before production updates
3. Follow React and Supabase release notes for new features

### Documentation Maintenance
Keep documentation updated:
1. Document all custom configurations
2. Maintain API documentation as endpoints change
3. Update this deployment guide as processes evolve
