# Raffle Platform Deployment Documentation

## Deployment Status

The raffle platform has been successfully deployed to Vercel and is now live and fully functional.

- **Production URL**: https://raffle-platform-implementation-5pq8raq99-alllin1s-projects.vercel.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/alllin1s-projects/raffle-platform-implementation

## Deployment Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, Next.js 14.0.4
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.0
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Hosting**: Vercel

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables have been configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: https://wmrkcxrpafsmaiasppkf.supabase.co
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [Configured in deployment]

### Resolved Issues
During the initial deployment attempt, we encountered build errors related to dependency versions. These issues have been resolved by:

1. Downgrading dependencies to more stable versions:
   - React from 19.0.0 to 18.2.0
   - Next.js from 15.2.4 to 14.0.4
   - Tailwind CSS from version 4 to 3.3.0

2. Converting configuration files:
   - Changed next.config.ts to next.config.js (the older Next.js version doesn't support TypeScript config)
   - Removed the experimental "--turbopack" flag from the dev script

3. Adding missing dependencies:
   - UI-related packages (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge)
   - Supabase authentication helpers (@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs)

## Accessing the Application

The application is now live and can be accessed at the production URL. The site includes the following pages:
- Homepage: `/`
- Authentication pages: `/auth/signin` and `/auth/signup`
- Main competition listing: `/main`
- Competition details: `/main/competitions/[id]`

## Maintenance and Updates

### Local Development
To run the application locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alllin1/turbo-octo-dollop.git
cd turbo-octo-dollop
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Deploying Updates
To deploy updates to the application:
1. Make your changes locally
2. Test with `npm run build`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically deploy changes from the main branch

### Monitoring
You can monitor the application's performance and logs through the Vercel dashboard.

## Security Considerations

- The Supabase authentication is properly configured
- Environment variables are securely stored in Vercel
- The application uses HTTPS for all communications

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing the following improvements:
- Set up a custom domain
- Configure additional Supabase tables and functions
- Implement CI/CD testing before deployment
- Add analytics tracking
